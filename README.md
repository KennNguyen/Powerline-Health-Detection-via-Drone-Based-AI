# ‚ö° Powerline Health Detection via Drone-Based AI  
### üõ† AI System for Florida Power & Light (FPL)

*An applied project using modern machine learning to inspect powerline infrastructure from UAV video. Designed for real-time analysis and future edge deployment.*

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Design an AI system that identifies visible defects in powerline infrastructure using drone video. While the current demo runs on a high-performance PC, it could simulate **edge deployment constraints** and includes a parallel lightweight model for future embedded applications. The system is engineered to tolerate real-world visual noise (glare, occlusion, fog) and support iterative model updates and fault logging.

## üß† Model Pipeline

### 1. üßº Data Processing
- Standardize to COCO format for RT-DETR training.
- Apply domain-specific augmentations (fog, glare, blur).
- Use diffusion models + CLIP for generating edge case samples.
- Self-supervised feature pretraining with **DINOv2** or **Masked Autoencoders (MAE)**.

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Model Selection & Training
- **Primary Model**: **RT-DETR** for detection and instance-level localization.
- **Segmentation Models**: U-Net or Mask2Former.
- **Multi-task Training**: Combine detection, segmentation, and defect classification.
- Tune via **Optuna/HyperOpt**. Add adversarial robustness (FGSM, PGD).

### 3. üìê Structural Postprocessing (Optional)
- Transform outputs into graph representations for anomaly analysis.
- Use **GNNs** to detect structural defects (e.g., missing insulators).
- Validate structure with **persistent homology**.

### 4. üîå Multimodal Fusion (Optional)
- Sync imagery with signal-based readings (e.g., discharge data).
- Prototype fusion models using **Perceiver IO** or cross-modal attention.

### 5. üß™ Evaluation & Robustness
- Metrics: mAP, IoU, AUROC, DSC.
- Robustness testing: glare, fog, occlusion simulation.
- Use **Monte Carlo Dropout**, **Deep Ensembles** for uncertainty.
- Test OOD response using entropy and Outlier Exposure techniques.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Off-Grid Simulation & Design Strategy

### 1. Deployment Simulation
- Full pipeline demonstrated on **desktop hardware (RTX 3080 Ti)**.
- Simulated edge deployment using constrained inference settings.
- Parallel lightweight model included to reflect Jetson-class performance.

### 2. Model Optimization
- Train heavy and light models concurrently (RT-DETR vs. MobileViT/YOLOv8n).
- Quantize lightweight models with QAT or post-training methods.
- Optimize with **TensorRT** or **TVM**; simulate RTSP ingestion via GStreamer.

### 3. Logging and Storage
- Store detection logs locally (JSON/CSV) with **timestamp and GPS**.
- On-device summaries emulate edge device behavior for post-flight reviews.

### 4. OTA Simulation
- Demonstrate patch updates via mock OTA scripts (simulated LoRaWAN).
- Integrate continual learning via **EWC** with misclassified samples.
